<p>I feel that my proven track record leading multi-functional teams makes me an excellent match for the job requirements.</p>
 <p>Also, the role excites me because I love the idea of helping to develop cutting-edge software products and I know I could start delivering results soonest as my field of interest and  the requirements of the company go hand in hand.
 </p>
 <p>when i applied for the job in commutatus i really went for the google search and started reading the reviews on glassdoor etc and this really attracted  because of the working environment ,the working group and all these constraints attracted me for the part.</p>
 <p>My logical approach towards any problem makes me eligible for the post and grabs my interest to work for the same.</p>
 <p>There was one thing common in most of the reviews saying that  you will get lot of opportunities to learn new stuff and  since being  a startup there are lots of learning curve for people who join.
